## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Whilst completing this challenge I made myself adopt a mobile-first intent. Though I think this is important for it's own reasons, it was good to actually just focus on one view, rather than trying to develop the mobile and desktop views simultaneously. 

### Continued development

- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile first development
- Though I didn't utilise it, I want to use React to solve these challenges. 

### Useful resources

- [FLEX Cheatsheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/) and [GRID Cheatsheet](https://grid.malven.co/) - These helped me for obvious reasons.
